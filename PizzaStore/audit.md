- `git remote` -> edit or remove connection to remote server
- `git clone` -> copy resources from remote server to local server
- `git push` -> copy resources from local server to remote server
- `git log` -> print history of virtual directory or local server

## secure shell [SSH]

- `ssh-keygen` -> generate a private/public keypair, similar to username and password, flags = -t (algorithm type), -b (binary length), -C (comment)
